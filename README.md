I built this as part of an interview for a developer position. The
code could use some linting, refactoring, and tests, but it works well
enough from a user standpoint. I could have perfected the app for
days...But, I figured it was enough to give the interviewer an idea of
what I could create in a few hours.

Here's a live demo: [Live Demo](http://ttmarek.github.io/freaking-math-clone/)
